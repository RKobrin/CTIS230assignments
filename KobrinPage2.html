<h2>Eagles' Pick (1,21)</h2>
<div class="firstpick">
<p class="pick">The Eagles went against the predictions of many in selecting Jalen Reagor. While his 40 yard dash wasn't impressive at the NFL Combine, <br> he made splashes at his pro day with a stunning time of 4.28 seconds (hand-timed finish). </p>
<p class="analysis">I honestly like this pick. While it may have been a bit of a reach, Reagor brings the vertical speed needed to really unlock the 2 TE system that the Eagles love to run.</p>

<h2> Eagles' Pick (2,53)</h2>
<div class="secondpick">
<p class="pick">The Eagles again shocked many analysts by selecting Jalen Hurts, a quarterback out of Oklahoma.</p>
<p class="analysis">I'm going to be honest here. I don't really understand this selection. While I believe Jalen Hurts can eventually be a solid quarterback in <br>
    the NFL, the Eagles recently gave Caron Wentz a large extension. This pick could have been better used on a corner, linebacker, or wide reciever.</p>
