<h1>NFL Draft Thoughts</h1>
<h2>Eagles' Pick (1,21)</h2>
<p>The Eagles went against the predictions of many in selecting Jalen Reagor. While his 40 yard dash wasn't impressive at the NFL Combine, <br> he made splashes at his pro day with a stunning time of 4.28 seconds (hand-timed finish). </p>
</body>
<p>I honestly like this pick. While it may have been a bit of a reach, Reagor brings the vertical speed needed to really unlock the 2 TE system that the Eagles love to run.</p>
