<h2>My Experience With FTC Robotics</h2>

<p class="introduction">I've had the pleasure of competing in FTC robotics for Team 731 Wannabee Strange for the past two years, and I feel like I have learned a lot about robotics design in this time. </p>
<p class="introduction">Because of this, I figured it would be cool to dedicate at least a page, if not the entire website, to documenting both my experiences and some knowledge.</p>

<h2>My Awards</h2>
<p class="awards">As a member of Team 731, I have had the pleasure of winning several awards. These include the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>North Carolina Inspire Award 2019
    </li>
    <li>World Championship Design Award Finalist 2019
    </li>

<h2>Website Purpose</h2>
<p>The purpose of this website is to act as a sort of knowledge dump from me to whoever reads this. 
    I've learned a lot in my 2 years on Wannabee Strange, and I want everybody to be able to experience
    the beauty of robotics like I have.</p>
