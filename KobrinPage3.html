<h2>My Experience With FTC Robotics</h2>
<p class="introduction">I've had the pleasure of competing in FTC robotics for Team 731 Wannabee Strange for the past two years, and I feel like I have learned a lot about robotics design in this time. </p>
<p class="introduction">Because of this, I figured it would be cool to dedicate at least a page, if not the entire website, to documenting both my experiences and some knowledge.</p>
